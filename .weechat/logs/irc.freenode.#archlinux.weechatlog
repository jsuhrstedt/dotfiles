2014-08-25 20:01:09	TheAtomicGoose	which de/wm do y'all recommend for a server? i don't really want a tiling manager but i want something for when i'm setting it up
2014-08-25 20:01:13	sudokode	the writing's okay, but I started on the show first, so it's just too pedantic
2014-08-25 20:01:19	sudokode	I prefer the sword of truth series
2014-08-25 20:01:26	cybrpnk	TheAtomicGoose: Xmonad. 
2014-08-25 20:01:33	TheAtomicGoose	cybrpnk: that's tiling

2014-08-25 20:02:28	TheAtomicGoose	i have xmonad on my main install...i might try openbox for the server
2014-08-25 20:02:28	McLenin	If you want a stricktly nontiling WM openbox is the way to go

2014-08-25 20:02:55	sudokode	TheAtomicGoose: no reason to use X on a server, but if you're looking for something simple, light, and non-tiling, openbox is the way to go
2014-08-25 20:03:02	cybrpnk	Gnome + the tiling plugin. 
2014-08-25 20:03:03	tomty89	just kill X when your are off
2014-08-25 20:03:03	sudokode	there's also blackbox and fluxbox
2014-08-25 20:03:12	cybrpnk	Though it fucks a lot of other apps.

2014-08-26 12:03:40	nononono	GodGinrai: yeah probably i tried that i think there were a lot of changes going from 3.9 to 3.10 related to wifi drivers though so it was kind of a mess
2014-08-26 12:04:06	wlhlm	ovrflw0x: That's true. 3Gbps is what the standard says an implementation can _theoretically_ have. This often means the actual bandwidth on the wire, which includes the protocol overhead so in reality the bandwidth is more like 80% of that (1.2Gbps instead of 1.5Gbps for SATAI). Harddrives are often slower than SATAII's maximum bandwidth, more like 100MB/s.
2014-08-26 12:04:19	nononono	Tazmain: blacklisting the module sounds like a pretty good idea

If I just paste those in and EndSection, then xorg is expecting more than just those bits....it wants a "ServerLayout" section with more than just a few snippets

2014-08-27 18:49:56	Hwkiller	the reason is that it provides an early userspace to bootstrap the rest of the system.
2014-08-27 18:50:07	Milos	yeah, so why do I need to run it every time I update the krenel

2014-08-27 18:51:03	Hwkiller	the kernel is built to bo mostly modular. as in, when you plug things in, it detects the device, issues an announcement, runs the module, etc. In early userspace, the kernel has no modules. it's just a kernel with the ability to load modules. the mkinitcpio is an image of a filesystem containing modules and such.
2014-08-27 18:51:11	Milos	you mean, mkinicpio changes the kernel that will be booted?
2014-08-27 18:51:28	Hwkiller	e.g., when you boot the kernel, it can load the modules it needs and start detection services, then mount your real partitions and switch over.
2014-08-27 18:51:52	thrice	Milos: no, it creates an early boot environment, /boot/initramfs-linux.img

2014-08-27 18:52:07	Milos	which contains no kernel right?
2014-08-27 18:52:11	Hwkiller	without the mkinitcpio, you don't have filesystem drivers, among other things. the kernel can't find your drivers (no filesystem detected), and nothing can start. modules change between kernel versions, so you need to remake it with each upgrade.

2014-08-27 18:52:50	thrice	21:52      Milos | which contains no kernel right?
2014-08-27 18:53:41	Milos	Hwkiller, that's right thanks for getting my point however I understand the purpose of an initrd, I come from a Gentoo background, and I don't need to update the initrd every time I upgrade the kernel. Apparently here, after every kernel upgrade mkinitcpio MUST be run. I'm trying to understand why.
2014-08-27 18:53:43	Hwkiller	Milos: when you install a modular kernel, there are few drivers built-in. to boot the system, your kernel needs to detect hard drives, filesystems, partitioning schemes, etc. without an initcpio, you have no drivers to detect anything. the kernel loads and can detect nothing.
2014-08-27 18:54:05	Hwkiller	Milos: maybe your kernel on gentoo had fs built-in
2014-08-27 18:54:07	Hwkiller	not modular.

2014-08-27 18:54:37	Hwkiller	you can build a kernel with partitioning schemes, fs, etc all built-in, so you can altogether skip the initcpio.
2014-08-27 18:54:43	Hwkiller	fs = filesystem
2014-08-27 18:54:45	thrice	Hwkiller: the kernel can't mount the root partition, without the support around.  but if that support (module) sits on the root partition, it's a chicken/egg problem
2014-08-27 18:54:47	Hwkiller	e.g., ext4
2014-08-27 18:54:57	Hwkiller	thrice: right.

2014-08-27 21:09:40	hemite	Boohbah, that returned nothing
2014-08-27 21:09:43	>	tyil has joined #archlinux
2014-08-27 21:09:58	duczen	i havent used grup with gpt (went w syslinux instead), but the wiki says to create the bios-boot partition at the beginning of the disk
2014-08-27 21:09:58	Boohbah	as it should
2014-08-27 21:10:22	hemite	Boohbah,  so how does this help me?
2014-08-27 21:10:28	AvianFlu	I'm on a chromebook right now, but I just wiped it and went MBR cause I didn't care about chromeos at all
2014-08-27 21:10:28	<	JacobGuy7800 has quit (Remote host closed the connection)
2014-08-27 21:10:36	duczen	it also says 'if needed, the partiton can be located somewhere else on the disk' but doesnt go into detail
2014-08-27 21:10:40	fatalhalt	Boohbah, i think i got the ordering right for my systemd script, how can I ensure ExecStop will run after mysql.service do you know by any chance? So I added 'Requires=local.service' 'After=local.service' to modified /etc/systemd/system/mysqld.service, basically I have a databse on mounted disk, I do the mounting before mysql starts and I want to unmount after mysql stops  
2014-08-27 21:10:47	Boohbah	hemite: fuse module is required for sshfs, and loading it creates /dev/fuse
2014-08-27 21:10:49	JZA	duczen: thats why I put it in sda11
2014-08-27 21:10:51	>	titanmech has joined #archlinux

2014-08-27 21:11:35	hemite	Boohbah, of course I already ran that before, I followed the arch wiki page on sshfs, it is not mounting
2014-08-27 21:11:38	JZA	duczen: I assumed the important part is that it's a boot type

2014-08-27 21:12:04	duczen	JZA, i would try it there first then, it can take a long time to move partitons
2014-08-27 21:12:09	Boohbah	hemite: did you setup pubkey auth?
2014-08-27 21:12:20	JZA	so how should I configure my grub?
2014-08-27 21:12:25	>	dr7 has joined #archlinux
2014-08-27 21:12:34	hemite	Boohbah, no, but this has nothing to do with authentication to the server
2014-08-27 21:12:52	hemite	this is the user not being able to call sshfs unless they're root
2014-08-27 21:12:52	JZA	First says this: grub-install --target=i386-pc --recheck /dev/sda but then said, For GPT-partitioned drives on BIOS motherboards, you also need a "BIOS Boot Partition".
2014-08-27 21:12:57	JZA	I guess I did that already right?

2014-08-28 21:24:58	meleu	that i have to set the desired font on /etc/vconsole.conf, i.e.: FONT=myfont
2014-08-28 21:25:00	meleu	i did this, but it doesn't work...
2014-08-28 21:26:20	meleu	(and yes, my FONT on vconsole is a valid font. present in /usr/share/kbd/consolefonts/)

2014-08-29 22:20:47	sudokode	I was once confronted outside of a library about a proposed method to deal with tourist traffic and answered honestly, but turned down the opportunity to give my name if my words happened to be quoted or paraphrased

2014-08-30 09:08:00	wasamasa	wget: then it's a gplv2 vs gplv3 issue
2014-08-30 09:08:01	wget	Rasi: As I got highlighted, I received an notification
2014-08-30 09:08:08	wget	wasamasa: Maybe.
2014-08-30 09:08:09	wasamasa	wget: and yes, snow leopard was the one I've used

2014-08-30 09:08:12	Rasi	thats what i meant, yea :P
2014-08-30 09:08:22	wasamasa	wget: they also have a really outdated emacs
2014-08-30 09:08:51	wget	Well I checked on my Mountain Lion VM and indeed no wget is present
2014-08-30 09:08:59	Earnestea	wasamasa: And I have no friggen idea what /XYZ means.  It says that it's "top left zoom".  Okay, zoom makes sense. But top and left?  "The distance from the origin of the page to the top-left corner of the window."  In what units?  What?!
2014-08-30 09:09:18	wget	But curl is.
2014-08-30 09:09:25	wasamasa	as I've said earlier, yes
2014-08-30 09:09:37	wasamasa	that would also mean they have a really old bash
2014-08-30 09:10:02	wget	wasamasa: 3.2 actually.
2014-08-30 09:10:10	Earnestea	wasamasa: "A common destination is upper-left-corner which is zoom 1 (100%) and left of -4 and top equal to the CropBox, or if no CropBox, 4.

2014-08-30 09:10:20	wget	This is rather annoying when I've some scripts using extended glob extensions.
2014-08-30 09:10:33	Earnestea	wasamasa: But you can name destinations
2014-08-30 09:10:35	wasamasa	^ that's the only bash4-feature I remember
2014-08-30 09:10:37	Earnestea	So that's kind of cool
2014-08-30 09:10:56	Earnestea	Doesn't help when the pdf doesn't use them, yay

2014-08-30 09:13:43	Earnestea	Erm, it's a pdf
2014-08-30 09:13:51	Earnestea	Ignore the .new nonsense
2014-08-30 09:14:01	wasamasa	what are these groups of dots called if they're used for story telling

2014-08-30 09:16:51	Earnestea	wasamasa: As for the device, it's a suspension point, used to build tension
